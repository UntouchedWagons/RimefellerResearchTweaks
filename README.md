# Rimefeller Research Tweaks
This is a simple research tweak mod that makes some of the Rimefeller researches less linear, mainly the researches that unlock material producing machines like Synthamide and Synthread. I always found it somewhat annoying that some techs would depend on largely unrelated techs, for example, Synthamide Production normally depends on Synthylene Production even though the Synthamide Refiner does not ever need Synthylene.

The cost of most research has been reduced, for example Deep Oil Wells costs 6000 which is as much as some of the space ship techs, it's not rocket science! Its cost has been reduced to 2500.

The research tab has also been reorganized to reflect the changes to prerequisites.
